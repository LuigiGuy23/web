    <br>
    <h1>pocket dungeon</h1>
    to start the game just use the first opsin or the one with the dash. <br>
    you start in the town, at day time the sky is clear or white and night black, <br>
    the first door is the prist no clue what she does on the left is the logger and docter. <br>
    the logger tells time spent playing and tiles walk. <br>
    the docter sells hp drink for 10 gp for 1 full heal, sadly you can't heal in battles. <br>
    Pro Tip use the down button on the dpad to go back in menus <br>
    on the right is the tracker and book. <br>
    the tracker will take all mosters kills and log them to be read at the book. <br>
    the book will show all mosters fighted and tell stats and fight paderns. <br>
    doing a 180 at the start with take you to the dungeon enterens DO NOT SAY YES TO THE GARD AT THE CAVE YOU WILL BRICK THE GAME!!!! <br>
